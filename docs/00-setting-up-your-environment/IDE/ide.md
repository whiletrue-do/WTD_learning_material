## Why Use VSCode?

Visual Studio Code, commonly known as VSCode, is a highly extensible and feature-rich code editor that offers several advantages:

### Lightweight

- **Fast Startup**: Unlike some IDEs, VSCode is lightweight and opens quickly, allowing you to jump right into coding.

### Extensible

- **Rich Marketplace**: With an extensive library of extensions, you can add languages, debuggers, and tools to your coding environment.

### Language Support

- **Multi-Language**: Out-of-the-box support for a wide range of programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, Go, and many more.

### Debugging

- **Built-in Debugger**: Debug code right from the editor with breakpoints, a call stack, and an interactive console.

### Git Integration

- **Version Control**: Built-in Git support allows you to pull, commit, push, and resolve merge conflicts directly within the editor.

### Customisable

- **Your Editor, Your Way**: Highly customizable, allowing you to change the editor's theme, keyboard shortcuts, and settings.

### Free and Open Source

- **Accessible**: VSCode is free to use and has an active community, making it a cost-effective and continually improving tool.

In summary, VSCode provides a powerful, customisable, and free platform that accommodates a wide range of development needs.
